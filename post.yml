      Conrad, I haven’t been shot in the head nearly enough times for that to sound like a good idea. Someone piss in your security chief’s coffee today?  This place is run down… even for a prison That's a straw, Tali The bartender over there? She's your father.

      Did they have anything that you could eat there? Hey everyone! This store discriminates against the poor! That doesn’t explain why you used my armor to fix yourself. Did they have anything that you could eat there? Call me princess again and you’ll be picking your teeth up off the floor.

      I don’t think our guest will be a problem. Will he? Sometimes it feels like the whole damn galaxy is trying to kill me. Wrex. Destroyed in a Collector surprise attack. I ended up spaced. Conrad, you have no idea what it takes to get the job done. This is how a gun in your face feels! It happens to me every day. You can’t handle this.

      I’d wait, if you’re okay with it. Disrupt the crew as little as possible… and take that last chance to find some calm just before the storm. Fighting a rogue Spectre with countless lives at stake and no regulations to get in the way? I’d say that beats C-Sec. You know me. Always like to savor that last shot before popping the heat sink... Wait, that metaphor just went somewhere horrible. I’m Garrus Vakarian and this is now my favorite spot on the Citadel! I’m Garrus Vakarian and this is now my favorite spot on the Citadel!

      Well, the third one died from a heart attack, so it’s not fair to count him. And damn, saying it that way doesn’t help. Now I feel dirty and clinical. Ha-ah! Don’t make me laugh, damn it. My face is barely holding together as it is. Besides, everyone was always overlooking you and hitting on me. Time for you to get a fair shot. We, ah, ended up holding a tiebreaker in her quarters. I had reach, but she had flexibility. More than one way to work off stress, I guess. I’m Garrus Vakarian and this is now my favorite spot on the Citadel!

      The Collectors killed you once, and all it did was piss you off. I can't imagine they'll stop you this time. You know me. Always like to savor that last shot before popping the heat sink... Wait, that metaphor just went somewhere horrible. A quarantine zone for a plague that kills turians. Why don’t we ever go anywhere nice? You sure you want to play this game? It'd be an awfully empty galaxy without you.
