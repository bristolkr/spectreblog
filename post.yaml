  - name: Conrad Verner can eat my @$$
    body: |
      Conrad, I haven’t been shot in the head nearly enough times for that to sound like a good idea. Someone piss in your security chief’s coffee today?  This place is run down… even for a prison That's a straw, Tali The bartender over there? She's your father.

      Did they have anything that you could eat there? Hey everyone! This store discriminates against the poor! That doesn’t explain why you used my armor to fix yourself. Did they have anything that you could eat there? Call me princess again and you’ll be picking your teeth up off the floor.

      I don’t think our guest will be a problem. Will he? Sometimes it feels like the whole damn galaxy is trying to kill me. Wrex. Destroyed in a Collector surprise attack. I ended up spaced. Conrad, you have no idea what it takes to get the job done. This is how a gun in your face feels! It happens to me every day. You can’t handle this.
